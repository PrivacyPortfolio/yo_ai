# multi channel evidence ingestion system

plugs directly into your Data Steward and produces a normalized ActivityLog you can publish to data.world.
I’ll break this into:
1.	What your Data Steward should automate
2.	How to unify all channels into one event schema
3.	How to detect, classify, and normalize communications
4.	How to generate a clean ActivityLog automatically
5.	How to publish to data.world without manual work
6.	How your other worker agents can help

1. What your Data Steward should automate
Right now, you’re manually:
-	Copying emails
-	Copying webform submissions
-	Copying portal messages
-	Copying phone call transcripts
-	Copying OneTrust portal interactions
-	Copying vendor responses
-	Copying your own replies
-	Tracking dates, channels, and risk
-	Assigning risk scores
-	Tracking responsiveness
-	Tracking escalation windows
-	Tracking policy violations
-	Tracking evidence for regulators

Your Data Steward can automate all of this.
The Data Steward should become your universal communications ingestion engine.

2. Unify all channels into one event schema
You already have the perfect foundation: your multi tenant audit log schema.
Extend it with a CommunicationEvent type:
CommunicationEvent fields
-	event_type: "communication"
-	channel: "email" | "webform" | "portal" | "phone" | "letter" | "social" | "unknown"
-	direction: "inbound" | "outbound"
-	organization: "Accenture", "Adidas", etc.
-	representative_identity: "named" | "anonymous" | "bot" | "unknown"
-	response_time_hours: computed automatically
-	risk_score: computed using your behavioral model
-	content_hash: SHA 256 of the message body (for evidence integrity)
-	raw_content_location: pointer to Dropbox / S3 / vault
-	attachments: list of stored evidence artifacts
-	thread_id: unify multi message threads
-	request_type: "CCPA-KNOW", "Privacy Question", "Verification", etc.
-	status: "responded" | "no response" | "inappropriate" | "redirect" | "fulfilled" | "denied"

This schema becomes the single source of truth for your ActivityLog.

3. How to detect, classify, and normalize communications
Your Data Steward should integrate with:

Email ingestion
-	IMAP/POP3 webhook
-	Parse sender, subject, body, attachments
-	Detect whether the sender is: 
o	identifiable
o	anonymous
o	a bot
o	a privacy team
o	a sales rep
-	Compute risk score
-	Store raw content in vault
-	Emit CommunicationEvent

Webform / OneTrust portal ingestion
-	Use a headless browser worker (or API if available)
-	Capture: 
o	submission timestamp
o	response timestamp
o	portal URL
o	response type
o	representative identity
-	Emit CommunicationEvent

Phone call ingestion
-	If you use a VoIP provider (Twilio, Google Voice, etc.): 
o	ingest call logs
o	store transcripts (if available)
o	classify caller identity
-	Emit CommunicationEvent

Social media ingestion
-	SocialMedia Checker agent already fits here
-	Detect impersonation, misappropriation, or promotional compliance
-	Emit CommunicationEvent

Dark web / data broker ingestion
-	DarkWeb Checker + DataBroker Monitor
-	When they detect your PI: 
o	store evidence
o	link to organization
o	emit CommunicationEvent with risk = HIGH

4. Automatically generate a clean ActivityLog
Once all channels emit CommunicationEvents, your Data Steward can:

Normalize
Convert all events into a unified row format:
-	Organization
-	Channel
-	Request Type
-	Request Date
-	Response Date
-	Response Type
-	Representative Identity
-	Risk Score
-	Evidence Hash
-	Evidence Location
-	Thread ID
-	Notes

Compute responsiveness
Your Data Steward can automatically compute:
-	response time
-	whether the organization responded within statutory windows
-	whether the representative was anonymous
-	whether the response was appropriate

Compute risk score
Using your behavioral model:
-	Anonymous + non responsive → 0.0–0.3
-	Quantifiable risk → 0.3–0.7 (your preferred zone)
-	Identifiable + responsive → 0.7–1.0

Export
Your Data Steward can automatically produce:
-	a clean CSV
-	a clean JSONL
-	a clean Parquet file
-	a clean data.world dataset payload

You never touch the messy raw data again.
________________________________________
5. Publishing to data.world
Your Data Steward can:
-	authenticate to data.world using an API token
-	publish the normalized ActivityLog on a schedule
-	update only new rows
-	maintain version history
-	attach evidence artifacts (hash linked)
-	maintain a public catalog of: 
o	risk scores
o	responsiveness metrics
o	policy violations
o	evidence manifests
This becomes your public transparency portal.

6. How your other worker agents help

Rewards Seeker
-	Flags organizations that offer incentives for sharing PI
-	Helps quantify opportunity value

Purchasing Agent
-	Tracks vendors who require PI for transactions
-	Detects when vendors behave responsibly or irresponsibly

Talent Agent
-	Tracks employers’ responsiveness
-	Detects discriminatory or automated decision making patterns

DarkWeb Checker
-	Flags organizations whose data appears in breach dumps
-	Provides evidence for complaints

DataBroker Monitor
-	Identifies which vendors purchased your data
-	Links broker → vendor → automated decision chain

All of these feed into your ActivityLog automatically.
________________________________________
🎯 The result
Your Data Steward becomes a fully automated evidence collection engine that:
-	ingests every communication
-	normalizes it
-	scores it
-	stores it
-	hashes it
-	links it
-	publishes it
-	and keeps your public data catalog up to date

No more manual CSV editing.
No more messy spreadsheets.
No more lost evidence.
Just a clean, regulator grade, multi channel, multi agent ActivityLog.

2. Normalization pipeline for all channels
Think of a single ingestion pipeline with channel specific adapters that all output CommunicationEvent.

High-level stages
1.	Capture raw events 
o	Email webhook / IMAP listener
o	Webform/portal callbacks
o	Phone system logs/transcripts
o	Social / dark web / data broker workers

2.	Channel-specific parsing 
o	Extract sender, recipient, timestamps, body, headers, URLs

3.	Classification 
o	Detect organization, representative identity, request_type, status

4.	Threading 
o	Assign/lookup thread_id using subject, organization, subject line, or DSAR IDs

5.	Risk scoring 
o	Compute risk_score + behavioral_risk_band

6.	Persist raw content 
o	Store full content & attachments in vault

7.	Emit normalized CommunicationEvent 
o	Store in your audit log + ActivityLog dataset

Pseudo-code sketch (Python style)
async def normalize_email(raw_email) -> CommunicationEvent:
    org = classify_organization(raw_email)
    rep_identity, rep_name, rep_contact = classify_representative(raw_email)
    request_type, status = classify_request_and_status(raw_email)
    thread_id = derive_thread_id(raw_email, org)
    content_hash = sha256(normalize_text(raw_email.body))
    raw_location = vault.store_email(org, raw_email, content_hash)

    # Look up previous event in this thread to compute response time
    previous = await events_repo.get_last_outbound_to_org(thread_id)
    response_time_hours = compute_response_time(previous, raw_email.date) if previous else None

    risk_score, band = compute_behavioral_risk(
        org=org,
        representative_identity=rep_identity,
        responded=True,
        response_time_hours=response_time_hours,
    )

    event = {
        "event_id": gen_uuid(),
        "timestamp": raw_email.date.isoformat() + "Z",
        "subject_id": SUBJECT_ID,
        "household_id": HOUSEHOLD_ID,
        "organization": org,
        "organization_unit": classify_org_unit(raw_email),
        "channel": "email",
        "direction": infer_direction(raw_email),
        "thread_id": thread_id,
        "related_request_id": extract_request_id(raw_email),
        "request_type": request_type,
        "status": status,
        "representative_identity": rep_identity,
        "representative_name": rep_name,
        "representative_contact": rep_contact,
        "response_time_hours": response_time_hours,
        "risk_score": risk_score,
        "behavioral_risk_band": band,
        "quantifiable_risk_usd": estimate_quantifiable_risk(org, request_type),
        "flow_type": infer_flow_type(request_type),
        "content_hash": content_hash,
        "raw_content_location": raw_location,
        "attachments": build_attachment_list(raw_email),
        "summary": summarize_email(raw_email),
        "metadata": {
            "subject": raw_email.subject,
            "headers": redact_headers(raw_email.headers),
        },
    }

    await events_repo.append(event)
    return event

# You’d have analogous normalize_webform, normalize_portal, normalize_phone, each converging to the same schema.

6. Worker agent collaboration diagram (conceptual)
Textual diagram of how agents interact around communications:

-	Data Steward
o	Central authority for subject + vault + risk scoring.
o	Owns CommunicationEvent generation and audit log.

-	Purchasing Agent
o	Initiates purchase flows, sends/receives emails/portal interactions with vendors.
o	For each interaction: 
	Emits raw event → Data Steward normalization → CommunicationEvent.
o	Uses risk_score to decide whether to proceed with a purchase.

-	Rewards Seeker
o	Interacts with loyalty vendors, portals, and SocialMedia Checker.
o	For each promotional verification or reward redemption: 
	Delegates any PI needs to Data Steward.
	For responses from vendors, forwards raw content to Data Steward for normalization.

-	Talent Agent
o	Applies to jobs, sends pitches, receives replies.
o	Pipes all comms into Data Steward → CommunicationEvent.
o	Uses risk bands to prioritize or avoid certain employers.

-	SocialMedia Checker
o	Scans for misappropriation and promotional compliance.
o	When it finds something: 
	Creates CommunicationEvent (channel = social, flow_type = mixed).
	Triggers Complaint Manager or Data Steward escalation.

-	DataBroker Monitor
o	Uses APIs/feeds from registered brokers.
o	Emits CommunicationEvents (channel = api/portal, flow_type = risk_mitigation).

-	DarkWeb Checker
o	Emits high risk CommunicationEvents when stolen PI is observed.

All of them:
-	Are PI blind.
-	Rely on Data Steward for minimized PI.
-	Use CommunicationEvent as the shared evidence primitive.
